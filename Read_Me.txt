*|*In the file Quant Task 1:
I have made two widely used indicators fisher transform and adx both are technical indicators.
the fisher transform uses basic method for normalizing the prices and then correlating them by using fisher transform on them
so that they follow gaussian distribution which ideally they do not follow.
For ADX
average directional index is just a trend identifier which signifies or shows how a asset is performing
Adx mainly constitutes +DI and -DI both are a identifer of positive trends or negative trends shoen by a 
stock.
Algorithm used for both is shown in the code.

*|*In the Quant Task 2:
Here I used Monte carlo simulation to predict the prices that a stock can have after n days
if the volatility of the stock is  provided and initial price is provided.
For this task i used random normal function to get the drift & getting the returns on the stocks after nth day
so i predicted the price using this.
Here i also shown that the frequency vs price of these stocks follow gaussian distribution because it was 
standardized about the mean.
showed the frequency histogram and showed the plot.
